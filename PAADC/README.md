The project Politieke Advertenties Analyse van Digitale Campagnes (Analysis of Political Ads in Digital Campaigns, henceforth PAADC) is tasked with monitoring and analysing Facebook sponsored content in relation to the Dutch general elections. Combining scraping Facebook posts with relevant survey data in the context of political elections, the project takes advantage of the synergy between digital methods and public opinion research to gain insights on the usage and effects of political micro-targeting, and the dynamics and popular perception of partiesâ€™ advertising strategies.

The project also published a peer [reviewed article](https://policyreview.info/articles/news/political-advertising-exposed-tracking-facebook-ads-2021-dutch-elections/1543).
