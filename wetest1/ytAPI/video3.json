    "description": "The coronavirus pandemic that popped up globally in 2019 and 2020 caught plenty of folks by surprise and it didn't take long for the world to learn that celebrities aren't immune to the virus, also known as COVID-19. Here are some of the high-profile actors, athletes, and politicians who have tested positive.\n\nOn March 11th, 2020, the NBA announced that it would suspend the remainder of its season, which naturally shocked fans. But the league had a good reason for doing so one of the players on the Utah Jazz tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nThat baller turned out to be Rudy Gobert, who broke the news on his Instagram page, writing,\n\n\"The first and most important thing is I would like to publicly apologize to the people that I may have endangered. At the time, I had no idea I was even infected.\"\n\nGobert went on to acknowledge how careless he had been before learning about his diagnosis, and he encouraged people to learn from his mistake. He added,\n\n\"I will do whatever I can to support using my experience as a way to educate others and prevent the spread of this virus.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Gobert wasn't the only NBA player to come down with coronavirus Utah Jazz teammate Donovan Mitchell also tested positive for the disease. And while he admitted he had to \"cool off\" after learning he had contracted the coronavirus from Gobert, Mitchell maintained a healthy perspective in a video-chat interview on Good Morning America.   Keep watching the video to see that these celebs have tested positive for Coronavirus.\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #corona\n\nRudy Gobert | 0:21\nDonovan Mitchell | 1:11\nFrancis Suarez | 2:01\nTom Hanks and Rita Wilson | 2:53\nOlga Kurylenko | 3:46\nIdris Elba | 4:35\n\nRead Full Article:  https://www.thelist.com/194938/celebs-who-have-tested-positive-for-coronavirus/",

    "description": "As Amazon orders surge, coronavirus delays deliveries and threatens to put sellers out of business. Millions of people are told to stay indoors amid coronavirus scares and grocery store shelves empty, Amazon is facing an unprecedented surge in online orders that’s causing delivery delays and certain items to run out of stock. \n\nDespite several workers testing positive for COVID-19, its 110 U.S. warehouses largely remain open as it works to meet customer needs. Amazon is also hiring 100,000 new workers and halting the intake of any inventory besides high-demand products like household staples and medical supplies. \n\nFor many of Amazon’s third-party sellers, this means a complete halt in business, while others face challenges as inventory is stuck in China.\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

Another 6,582 infections have been announced in the past 24 hours and the number of deaths has now reached 2,696.\n\nThe capital Madrid continues to be the epicentre of Spain's pandemic, with 1,535 deaths. The north-east region of Catalonia is now also becoming a big cause for concern with 1,939 cases in the past day, higher than Madrid.\n\nHealth emergency chief Fernando Simón has stressed that almost 3,800 people have now recovered from the virus but 2,636 remain in intensive care.\n\n\"This is a tough week and we are all hoping to see if we are managing to reach the peak and start going down, with these very aggressive measures that have been imposed on Spain\".\n\nAttention has also turned to the alarming rate of infection among health professionals. Of the 39,763 infected people around the country, 5,400 are healthcare staff - meaning they make up nearly 14% of those with the disease.\n\nThe government has asked MPs to extend the state of alert to 11 April.\nPlease subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog",

    "title": "8 Dream Signs You Shouldn't Ignore",
    "description": "Do dreams actually have meanings? Or are they just short movies that your subconsciousness randomly creates? Dreams have always fascinated people. To this day, psychologists conduct extensive research to try and figure out what happens in our mind and body when we sleep. \n\nIn ancient Egypt, those with colorful and vivid dreams were considered to be special people. So special that most of their dreams were recorded on papyrus! The Egyptians firmly believed that divine revelation came from dreams, in which you could find all the answers to your worries and gain wisdom. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Sigmund Freud, a famous neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, introduced his perception of dreaming in his book The Interpretation of Dreams. According to Freud, when your consciousness is asleep and resting, your subconsciousness wakes up and produces images that give you a little sneak peek into your deepest self.\n\nTIMESTAMPS: \nFlying 1:45\nFalling 2:24\nBeing lost 3:22\nBeing chased 4:00\nBeing trapped 4:46\nLosing teeth 5:32\nBeing naked 6:14\nMeeting a celebrity 7:00\n\nMusic by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ \n\nSUMMARY: \n- Flying might show that you have too much on your plate at the moment and that you desperately want to “fly above” all your problems. Either way, these dreams are a way for your subconsciousness to tell you that something needs to be changed if you want to feel this level of lightness and happiness in reality.\n- If somebody pushed you, this means you're putting too much pressure on yourself. If you know the person who pushed you, they're probably the one to blame for your stress.\n- The most obvious one is that you have lost your way in reality, and you know that deep down — but you keep going. Your subconsciousness is trying to reach out and warn you that you're going in the wrong direction.\n- Dreams of being chased are especially common among people who suffer from anxiety and depression. Psychologically speaking, these dreams reflect that you're trying to avoid something in your waking life. So next time you have this dream, try to remember who was chasing you. \n- Psychologists suggest that being trapped in a dream can show that you're holding on to your past and, therefore, can't live fully in your present. Take some time to re-evaluate your behavior, habits, and attitude. Make sure they reflect the current you, not somebody you used to be. \n- Psychologists are sure that dreams about your teeth are closely connected to the fear of losing your attractiveness and youth. You're afraid that people will reject you if you become less appealing. And even though it seems like a completely natural fear, if such dreams are recurring, it's a serious problem.\n- If you notice that you often have dreams in which you appear naked in front of people, this might indicate that you often try to hide your true personality to please others. In this way, “naked” dreams are similar to those in which you lose teeth — with one little exception: it's not about your looks.\n- According to Lauri Loewenberg, dream expert and author of the book Dream on It: Unlock Your Dreams, Change Your Life, if celebrities are frequent guests in your dreams, it may signify your desire for the validation and recognition you're not getting.\n\nSubscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur Social Media:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/\n\n5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more videos and articles visit:\nhttp://www.brightside.me/",

    "description": "The federal government is calling on Canada's manufacturing companies to join the fight against COVID-19 by ramping up production of vital supplies, like medical supplies. But as Mike Armstrong reports, things aren't so rosy for a different industry.\n\nMeanwhile, the virus has led to the unemployment of thousands of Canadians, and the federal government is racing to mitigate the damage of what may be the worst economic downturn in the country's history. David Akin reports on how much the federal government’s potential support package could be worth.\n\nThe U.S. is ramping up its war against COVID-19 by closing its borders with Canada and Mexico to non-essential travel, while lockdowns are in effect in both California and New York. But what about a nationwide lockdown? And what would U.S. President Donald Trump say to Americans who are scared? Jackson Proskow has Trump's reaction to both of those questions.\n\nThe British government is also taking drastic measures to help citizens who can't work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Redmond Shannon explains what's being promised.\n\nScores of Canadians working and living abroad are trying in vain to return home, but travel restrictions and bans over COVID-19 have them fearing they'll be stranded indefinitely. Ross Lord has the calls for help from Canadians stuck in Peru.\n\nThere's a worldwide outpour of gratitude for health care workers, who are putting themselves at risk while treating a surge of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eric Sorensen explains how their difficult work is being honoured.\n\n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/6710672/canada-coronavirus-1000-cases/\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\r\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\r\nFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\r\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\r\n#coronavirus #health #GlobalNews",
